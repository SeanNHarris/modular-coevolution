# modular-coevolution
A competitive coevolution library by Sean Harris.

The `modular-coevolution` library contains general-purpose functions for competitive coevolutionary algorithms, including evolutionary genotypes and agents, genetic programming tools, as well as the functions which coordinate evolution and coevolution.

Examples and tutorials are provided in the [modular-coevolution-examples](https://github.com/SeanNHarris/modular-coevolution-examples) repository.
